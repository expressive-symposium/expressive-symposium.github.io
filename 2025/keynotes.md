		  <!-- <p>Abstract:<br/>I discuss whether computers, using Artificial Intelligence, could create art. I review important points in the history of automation in art, examining the hype and reality of AI tools for art together with predictions about they will be used. The nature of current computer-generated art is discussion, and then it is hypothesized when we might ever credit an AI with authorship of art.</p> -->

		  <p>Biography:<br/>Paul Debevec received degrees in Computer Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1992 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996. He is the Chief Research Officer at Netflix’s Eyeline Studios, an Adjunct Research Professor at the University of Southern California, and a Governor of the Visual Effects Branch of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences as well as a co-chair of the Academy's Sci-Tech Council. Paul's work in technology for visual effects and virtual production has been recognized with two Academy Awards for Scientific and Technical Achievement, the Progress Medal from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, and in 2022, the Charles F. Jenkins Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award.</p>
