		  <p>Abstract:<br/>Compositing real actors into virtual environments has been a challenge in visual effects since the early days of motion pictures. Techniques such as rear projection, front projection, blue screen, and sodium vapor matting have provided innovative solutions for integrating actors seamlessly into virtual backgrounds. However, achieving realistic lighting has remained a critical hurdle.

		  The development of light stage systems aimed to solve this issue by ensuring actors are illuminated in a way that matches their environments, leading to fully believable composites. After numerous prototypes, the studio-sized light stage is now ready. This talk will provide an overview of its development and explore the new production techniques it enables, including lighting reproduction, relighting, and large-scale volumetric capture.</p>

		  <p>Biography:<br/>Paul Debevec received his degrees in Computer Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1992 and earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1996. He is currently the Chief Research Officer at Netflix’s Eyeline Studios, an Adjunct Research Professor at the University of Southern California, and a Governor of the Visual Effects Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
		  His contributions to visual effects and virtual production have been featured in films such as The Matrix, Avatar, and Gravity. His work has been recognized with two Academy Awards, the SMPTE Progress Medal, and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award.

		  <!-- <p>Abstract:<br/>I discuss whether computers, using Artificial Intelligence, could create art. I review important points in the history of automation in art, examining the hype and reality of AI tools for art together with predictions about they will be used. The nature of current computer-generated art is discussion, and then it is hypothesized when we might ever credit an AI with authorship of art.</p> -->

		  <p>Biography:<br/>Yi-Zhe Song is a Professor of Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP). He leads the SketchX Lab, focusing on understanding human visual systems through sketch data. He is an Associate Editor for IEEE TPAMI and Frontiers in Computer Science – Computer Vision, and has served as Area Chair for major conferences like ECCV, CVPR, and ICCV. SketchX consistently publishes in top-tier conferences and journals, including winning a Best Paper Award at BMVC 2015.

Prof. Song founded and leads the MSc in AI programme at Surrey and previously established a similar programme at Queen Mary University of London. He holds a PhD from the University of Bath, an MSc from the University of Cambridge, and a Bachelor's Degree from Bath. He is a Senior Member of IEEE, a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, and a member of the EPSRC review college.</p>
