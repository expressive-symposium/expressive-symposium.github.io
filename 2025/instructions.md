Submissions will be made electronically through the Eurographics Submission and Review Management [SRM]({{site.symposium[2025].submission}}) system. Submitted papers must be anonymous and formatted according to the Eurographics [Author’s guidelines](http://expressive.graphics/2025/instructions/). There is no strict page limit, but the length should justify the contribution.

### Paper formatting

Manuscripts must be written in English. They should follow the [Eurographics publication guidelines](https://www.eurographics2019.it/index.php/for-submitters/full-papers/), including a title page with an abstract, keywords, and a bibliography. For formatting, please use the [Eurographics Full Paper layout](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2025/Instruction).

* LaTeX [template](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2025/GetConferenceFile?fileID=8929).
* A Microsoft Word template is not available.  Please format according to the [instructions](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2025/Instruction).

### Supplemental material

Supplemental material such as additional images or videos may be submitted as PDF or as a zipped archive (ZIP files) with a maximum size of 30 MB.

#### Video Formatting
