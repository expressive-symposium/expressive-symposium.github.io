### Expressive+WICED 2025 is officially co-located with Eurographics 2025 in London!

For the first time, the Expressive symposium and WICED workshop will be joining hands this year at Eurographics in London.

## Aims and Scope
{: .top1}
The Expressive+WICED event explores the capacity of computer graphics, animation, and computational media to be used in artistic, aesthetic, and creative ways. The field can be seen as encompassing problems in expressive __understanding__, expressive __communication__, and expressive __interaction__:

* Expressive __understanding__ integrates aspects of computer science, philosophy, psychology, and the fine, applied, and performing arts, investigating theoretical approaches that further our understanding of aesthetic evaluation, perception and meaning, on general media or specifically on feature films

* Expressive __communication__ focuses on imagery and motion which is expressive rather than photorealistic, although it may incorporate realistic elements, with dimensions related to visual composition design, style transfer, stylistic rendering, generative video contents and computational cinematography

* Expressive __interaction__ explores models, algorithms, and technologies for sketch-based and XR interfaces, particularly classifying and recognizing hand-drawn shapes as a way to create or edit digital models, text, mathematics, or 3D shapes. In cinematographic applications, expressive interactions can encompass automatic camera control, AR movie making, expressive performances of virtual characters, or camera path planning, for instance.

The event is organized through a joint submission system with two specific tracks, one for Expressive-related themes and one for WICED-related themes.

[Expressive+WICED 2025](http://expressive.graphics/2025/) will take place in London, UK, on May 12th 2025 - co-located with Eurographics 2025. The symposium will also include an arts program, posters, and demos related to both tracks.
