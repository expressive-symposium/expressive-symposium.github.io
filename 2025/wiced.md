Virtual cameras, mise-en-scene, lighting and editing (montage) are regularly used in 3D synthetic environments for visual media such as film, games, and virtual reality. While often invisible to the public eye, their use increases the effectiveness of the content in engaging their audiences, creating more impactful and emotional experiences. At the same time, recent advances in computer vision-based object, actor, and event recognition, face tracking, and camera motion estimation make it possible to new kinds of automation in film, television and other videographic media, such as re-cinematography (re-lighting, re-framing) and automatic editing of videos. 

The WICED workshop series is intended to bridge the gap between these topics of research and confront challenges in these domains. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and industrial experts working in all aspects of digital cinematography and film editing in their respective fields, including 3D graphics, artificial intelligence, computer vision, visualization, interactive narrative, cognitive and perceptual psychology, computational linguistics, computational aesthetics and visual effects.

We invite submissions in the form of regular papers and invited papers (1 page abstract of relevant work already published in other venues).

WICED 2025 is organized as a joint event with Expressive 2025, and co-located with Eurographics 2025.
